/*
Question: 
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
*/

Solution:
select CASE 
When A+B<=C or A+C<=B or B+C<=A then 'Not A Triangle' 
when A=B and B=C then 'Equilateral' 
when A=B or B=C or A=C then 'Isosceles' 
ELSE 'Scalene' END AS Output from TRIANGLES;
